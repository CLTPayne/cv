Having always had a keen desire to create and build things with my own hands I am excited to now be learning to code at Makers Academy. I am particularly enjoying JavaScript and am eager to explore more design patterns. From day one, I've documented my learning experience here on [Instagram][2].

I have spent 10 years in the media and entertainment industry and have crept closer and closer to tech products but been frustrated that I couldn't improve them myself. With interests spanning music, film, fashion, literature and design I'm looking for a junior developer role that will enable me to learn constantly, build my skills and benefit from my previous industry know-how.

I am determined to apply myself to the growth of a dynamic organisation – not just fulfil a job specification.

## Skills

#### Day-to-day
- Getting stuff done (completing the Makers Academy pre-course while in a senior full time position)
- Not giving up (using Twitter to convince a music artist to perform at a festival for a fraction of their fee)
- Attention to detail (I love how my git config keeps my commit summary to maximum 50 characters)
- Communication (I've spent a decade writing emails and talking for a living!)
- Iterating and improving on things (it's taken a year of effort but I can finally do a wheel in yoga, and hold it)
- Questioning things (I'm a [Questioner][7])
- Doing things with my hands (anything from repotting plants to folding Japanese dumplings)
- Taking inspiration from around me (I made a series of plaster candle holders after [this exhibition][8]!)

#### Clean Code
I see code as a visual artefact and clean code can even be a beautiful abstract pattern (amplified by the Dracula theme).

- Implementing the principles of DRY and SOLID
- Advocating consistent commit style and reviewing code for readability on group projects   

#### Pair Programming
I prioritise taking the time to understand the other person's needs and goals in order to set up a shared approach to the task.

- Received consistent peer feedback stating that I'm considerate and thoughtful while remaining focused on the goal and having a methodical approach
- Regularly seek out senior developers to pair with in personal time
- Dedicated to the emotional intelligence curriculum at Makers

#### Project Management
Planning and execution is my thing. I thrive on making sure my high standards are upheld, delivering in a fast-paced environment with multiple stakeholders.

- Worked with the likes of The Prodigy, Rita Ora, Take That, Zoella, KSI and Tanya Burr.
- Routed and planned large music tours across the world.
- Built and led three person team of project managers delivering influencer marketing campaigns.

#### Marketing & Media
I have gained expertise in social media, online advertising and online video with particular focus on how influencers can work collaboratively with brands. About 8 years ago I gave up buying print media and switched to online alternatives, with a clear trajectory in my consumption: magazines and newspapers >> blogs and Instagram feeds for culture and inspiration >> YouTube videos for instruction.

- Generated +160 million YouTube views and engagements on brand sponsored projects including [H&M][9], [Pandora][10], [Disney][11], [Visit The USA][12], [EE][13] and [Rimmel][14].
- Developed trust with media agency teams at Zenith, OMD, Publicis and MediaCom through sharing of specialist knowledge in the influencer space and dedicated client servicing.
